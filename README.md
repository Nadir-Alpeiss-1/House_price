# Welcome to My Tu Verras
***

## Task
The task is designed to help to understand how the data can be cleaned up and analyzed using different functions of libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, sklearn. Also, the linear regression model was created and checked using the input as an array of values and also some mathematical checks such as mean absolute error etc.

## Description
I followed the instructions given and was trying all the hints in the jupyter notebook. I have also used some prior knowledge from the previous task IRIS dataset. After some explorations I have solved the problem. 

## Installation
One can use the jupyter notebook to see how the code works. To do so one have to enter in the terminal console the following: "jupyter notebook --no-browser" (enter). After that when one sees green lines coming it is needed to copy the link (e.g. http://fa16d5343-da55.docode.us.qwasar.io/#/home/docode/project) and add the web inside the link after http://, e.g. http://web-fa16d5343-da55.docode.us.qwasar.io/#/home/docode/project. After that enter the password: "qwasar" in the page coming. Select the first file called "my_ty_verras.ipynb". There will be a jupyter notebook window where one has to press play button.

## Usage
There are also some navigation comments in the file itself, so it is easier to understand the code. After pressing play button all the tables and graphs will come out. If user wants to experiment then he or she can change the values of an array (number of rooms). 

### The Core Team
I have solved the problem by myself since I did not have a partner for quite a while, so the group was closed.
